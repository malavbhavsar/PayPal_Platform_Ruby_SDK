#PayPal_Platform_Ruby_SDK

Working Paypal adaptive payment, adaptive account, permissions SDK for rails 3.2.8 (original: https://www.x.com/sites/default/files/paypal_platform_ruby_sdk.zip)

The original SDK, provided by PayPal, doesn't have dependancies up-to-date. I spent some time and made it work on latest rails and sqlite3. I still have to fix the tests. They are not running for some reasons.
